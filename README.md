# Data-Analysis-Using-Python-Statistics---Spotify
## Project Overview

The majority of music business income have come from streaming services such as Spotify, iTunes, Youtube, and others. Additionally, knowing what drives popularity in streaming music might have a significant influence on commercial decisions for the music industry.

For this project, we used the Spotify API to extract 200000 tracks, which allowed us to do data mining. This allowed us to create a prediction model for track popularity and analyse the evolution of the music business.

## Project Objectives

**Examine the evolution of music during the last 20 years.** 

  As an illustration:
   
 *Is the music typically louder now than it was previously?
   
 *What new musical genres have been popular during the last five years?*


Here, l have explored and quantified data about music and drawn valuable insights.

Conducted data cleaning to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Spotify dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn).

Data analysis - Exploring the relationship between the audio features of a song and how positive or negative its lyrics are, involving sentiment analysisand manyuy more.

Spotify Data Analysis makes use of secondary data from Spotify. Use data to identify patterns and relationships between different characteristics. The activity will support in developing ability to review and interpret a dataset.
